Invescent: Privacy policy
Welcome to Invescent for Android!

This is an open source Android app developed by Invescent. The source code is currently not available.

As an avid Android user myself, I take privacy very seriously. I know how irritating it is when apps collect your data without your knowledge.

I have not programmed this app to collect any personally identifiable information. All data will be gone once the app is uninstalled from your device. 

If you find any security vulnerability that has been inadvertently caused by me, or have any question regarding how the app protectes your privacy, please send me an email and I will surely try to fix it/help you.

Yours sincerely,
Invescent,
NY, New York.
